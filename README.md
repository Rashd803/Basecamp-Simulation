## Project Overview
This is the complete version of the DB, includes:
- Tables

- After Triggers

### Architecture & Design
Implemented using **N-Tier Architecture** principles. The project utilizes **Data Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** by handling logic through Stored Procedures and Views. 

This completes the **Data Tier**. The next stage will focus on the **Data Access Layer**, followed by the **Business Layer** and **RESTful API** development for a full **3-Tier Architecture**.
